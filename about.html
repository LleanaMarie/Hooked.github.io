            <h4>Since our launch in 2024, Hooked has grown from a bold idea into the
                world's largest social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people.
                With millions of daily users across nearly every country on the planet,
                we've become a global hub where LGBTQ individuals connect, share, and
                thrive — all powered by our cutting-edge, location-based technology.</h4>
            <br>    
            <h4>But we're not stopping there.</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>As we continue to evolve, Hooked is proud to stand at the forefront of
                a modern LGBTQ lifestyle that reaches far beyond the screen.
                From championing social justice and amplifying queer voices, to producing
                original content and expanding onto new platforms, we're redefining what it
                means to be part of a digital community. Every step forward is about creating
                space for real connection, self-expression, and meaningful impact.</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>At Hooked, we've built more than just an app — we've created a safer, more
                inclusive space where you can explore, express, and discover the vibrant
                queer world around you. Whether you're just down the block or near_me 0 feet away,
                your next connection is closer than ever.</h4>
